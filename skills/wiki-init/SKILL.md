# Wiki Init

Bootstrap a new LLM-maintained wiki at a user-specified path.

## Pre-flight

Check whether a `SCHEMA.md` already exists nearby. If yes, ask the user if they want to reinitialize or just continue with the existing wiki.

## Process

### 1. Gather configuration (one question at a time)

Ask:
1. **Where should the wiki live?** (absolute path, e.g. `~/wikis/ml-research`)
2. **What is the domain/purpose?** (one sentence)
3. **What types of sources will you add?** (papers, URLs, code files, transcripts, etc.)
4. **What categories should `index.md` use?**
   - Research default: `Sources | Entities | Concepts | Analyses`
   - Codebase default: `Modules | APIs | Decisions | Flows` — see `codebase.md` in this skill's directory for detailed codebase guidance
   - Or specify custom

### 2. Create directory structure

```
<wiki-root>/
├── SCHEMA.md         ← conventions + absolute path (how other skills find the wiki)
├── .gitignore        ← local-only artifacts (audit reports) excluded from version control
├── raw/              ← immutable source documents (you add these, LLM never modifies)
├── wiki/
│   ├── index.md      ← content catalog: every page, one-line summary, by category
│   ├── log.md        ← append-only operation log
│   ├── overview.md   ← evolving synthesis of everything known
│   └── pages/        ← all wiki pages, flat, slug-named (NO subdirectories)
└── assets/           ← downloaded images, PDFs, attachments
```

**Critical:** `wiki/pages/` is flat. All pages live here as `<slug>.md`. No subdirectories. Slugs are lowercase, hyphen-separated.

Ensure `<wiki-root>/.gitignore` excludes audit reports (if the wiki is or later becomes a
git repo, this keeps disposable artifacts out of version control). **Do not clobber an
existing `.gitignore`** — a reinitialized wiki, or a wiki root nested in an existing git
repo, may already have one:
- If `<wiki-root>/.gitignore` does not exist, create it with the block below.
- If it exists but has no `wiki/pages/audit-*.md` line, append the block below.
- If it already ignores `wiki/pages/audit-*.md`, leave it untouched.

```
# Audit reports are regenerated local-only artifacts (wiki-audit). The committed record
# of an audit is the `review:` frontmatter token on the audited page, not the report.
wiki/pages/audit-*.md
```

This is the same create-or-append discipline `wiki-audit` uses to self-heal (Task 4).

### 3. Write `SCHEMA.md`

```markdown
# Wiki Schema

## Identity
- **Path:** <absolute path to wiki-root>
- **Domain:** <user's domain description>
- **Source types:** <list>
- **Created:** <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Page Frontmatter
Every wiki page must start with:
---
title: <page title>
tags: [tag1, tag2]
sources: [source-slug1]
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

## Cross-References
Use `[[slug]]` where slug = filename without `.md`.
Example: `[[transformer-architecture]]` → `wiki/pages/transformer-architecture.md`

## Citations

Cite every non-common-knowledge factual claim. "Common knowledge" = uncontroversial,
undergraduate-level facts in this wiki's domain. Granularity is paragraph or claim,
never per-sentence. If you cannot produce a citation in one of the forms below,
find one, weaken the claim, or drop it.

Format: Markdown footnotes. Two citation kinds, three valid targets.

**Quote citation** (preferred):
```
The model uses 8 attention heads.[^1]

[^1]: [[attention-is-all-you-need]] §3.2.2 L142-143 — "We employ h = 8 parallel attention layers"
```

**Synthesis citation** (when no single quote captures the claim):
```
The architecture is fundamentally an encoder-decoder with attention.[^2]

[^2]: [[attention-is-all-you-need]] §3.2-3.4 [synthesis] L138-202 — encoder, decoder, and
      attention sections together describe the full multi-head architecture
```

`L142-143` / `L138-202` are line ranges in the raw source file. For a quote they mark
the lines the quote is taken from; for a synthesis they mark the block being summarized.

Three rules for every footnote:

1. **The cited target is one of three forms:**
   - `[[source-slug]]` — a source-type wiki page (preferred for sources you've
     ingested via `wiki-ingest`)
   - `raw/<file>` or `assets/<file>` — a path to a local file (for drive-by
     citations where a synthesis page isn't worth creating)
   - `<URL>` — a live URL, tweet, or ephemeral source (no local copy required)

   Never cite entity, concept, or analysis pages — those are syntheses, not sources.

2. **A locator is present.** Always a semantic locator: `§<section>`, `p.<n>`,
   `[HH:MM:SS]` for transcripts, URL anchor for web, or `(YYYY-MM-DD)` for dated posts.

   **Plus a line-range when the source is text-addressable.** If the resolved raw
   file is markdown, plaintext, code, or cached HTML, append a line-range token after
   the semantic locator:

   - `L<start>-<end>` — a range, e.g. `L142-145`
   - `L<n>` — a single line, e.g. `L142`
   - `L142-145,L201-203` — disjoint ranges

   The line range refers to lines in the **raw source file** resolved from the target
   (`[[slug]]` → its `**Source:**` raw path; or a direct `raw/<file>`/`assets/<file>`).
   `raw/` is immutable, so these line numbers are stable references.

   A line-range is **required** for text-addressable sources and applies to BOTH
   citation kinds — a `[synthesis]` footnote marks the block it summarizes with `L…`
   just as a quote marks the lines it quotes. **Exempt** (semantic locator only, no
   `L…`): PDFs, transcripts, and live URLs with no local cached copy.

3. **Either a verbatim quote, or the `[synthesis]` tag plus a description** of
   what the cited range supports. No third option.

**Drive-by citation examples:**
```
[^3]: raw/scaling-laws.pdf p.7 — "loss scales as a power law in compute"
[^4]: https://twitter.com/user/status/123 (2026-04-15) — "<tweet text>"
```

## Cross-Model Review

`wiki-audit strong` runs a second-opinion pass with a different-provider model and
stamps the audited page with an optional `review:` frontmatter block:
```
review:
  model: codex          # gemini | claude-sonnet
  provider: openai      # google | anthropic
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  status: clean         # or: disputed
  findings: 2           # present only when status: disputed
```
- `status: clean` — the reviewer surfaced no disagreement with the normal audit.
- `status: disputed` — the reviewer flagged overreach or a contradiction the normal
  audit missed; `findings:` carries the count. The detail lives in the (local-only)
  audit report.
- `provider: anthropic` (the `claude-sonnet` fallback) means no different-provider CLI
  was available, so the check is same-provider and weaker.

This block is optional and is added only by `wiki-audit strong`. Pages never need it to
be valid.

## Log Entry Format
## [YYYY-MM-DD] <operation> | <title>
Operations: init, ingest, query, update, lint, audit

## Index Categories
<one per line, matching the user's chosen taxonomy>

## Conventions
- raw/ is immutable — skills never modify it
- log.md is append-only — never rewritten, only appended
- index.md is updated on every operation that adds or changes pages
- All pages live flat in wiki/pages/ — no subdirectories
- overview.md reflects the current synthesis across all sources
<if codebase domain>
- README boundary: wiki pages must not duplicate README content. Extract structural signals; link to the README for operational content (setup, contributing, running). When ingesting any README, also evaluate it for gaps and suggest edits.
</if>
```

### 4. Write `wiki/index.md`

```markdown
# Wiki Index — <domain>

<for each category>
### <Category Name>
<!-- entries added by wiki-ingest -->
```

### 5. Write `wiki/log.md`

```markdown
# Wiki Log

Append-only. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <operation> | <title>`
Recent entries: `grep "^## \[" log.md | tail -10`

---

## [<today>] init | <domain>
```

### 6. Write `wiki/overview.md`

```markdown
---
title: Overview
tags: [overview, synthesis]
sources: []
updated: <today>
---

# <Domain> — Overview

> Evolving synthesis of everything in the wiki. Updated by wiki-ingest when sources shift the understanding.

## Current Understanding

*No sources ingested yet.*

## Open Questions

*Add questions here as they arise.*

## Key Entities / Concepts

*Populated as pages are created.*
```

### 7. Confirm

Tell the user:
- Wiki initialized at `<path>`
- Add sources to `raw/` manually, or run `wiki-ingest` directly with a URL or file path
- Run `wiki-lint` periodically to keep the wiki healthy
- `SCHEMA.md` is how all other skills locate this wiki — do not move or delete it
